### **Time and Tempo**

#### **Purpose**: Set and adjust the song’s pace to align with its emotional tone.

**Techniques**:

1. **Define the Tempo Early**:
    
    - Use a metronome or DAW to set BPM.
    - Example:
        - Upbeat Pop: 100–130 BPM.
        - Ballads: 60–80 BPM.
        - Dance/Electronic: 120–150 BPM.
2. **Use Tempo Changes Sparingly**:
    
    - Slow down slightly in the bridge for tension, then return to tempo.
    - Example: From 120 BPM to 110 BPM, back to 120 BPM.
3. **Add Rhythmic Variations**:
    
    - Switch between straight and syncopated rhythms to add interest.
