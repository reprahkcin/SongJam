### **Writing Verses**

#### **Purpose**: Verses provide the story or details, setting the context for the emotion expressed in the chorus.

**Best Practices**:

- **Be Descriptive**:
    - Use imagery and sensory details to paint a scene.
    - Example: _"The coffee’s cold, the clock’s stopped ticking."_
- **Develop the Narrative**:
    - Each verse builds on the previous one.
    - Example: Verse 1: Describe the breakup. Verse 2: Reflect on its impact.

#### Techniques:

- **Rapid-Fire Drafting**:
    - Set a timer for 2 minutes and write non-stop about the theme.
    - Example: For heartbreak:
        - "Rain on the window. Empty bed. Stillness in the air. Your photo on the floor."
- **Question Method**:
    - Answer these questions to shape your verse:
        1. What happened?
        2. How did it feel?
        3. What does it remind you of?
