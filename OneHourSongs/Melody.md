### **1. Start with the Foundation**

#### **Chords as a Framework**

- Use the underlying chord progression to guide your melody. Starting with chord tones (root, third, fifth) creates a natural sense of harmony.
- Experiment with **non-chord tones** (passing tones, neighbor tones) for tension and movement.

**Example:**

- Chord progression: C–G–Am–F.
- Melody: Start with C (root of C), then E (third of C), move to D (non-chord tone, resolves to B of G).

---

### **2. Play with Contour and Range**

#### **Contour**: The shape of the melody (ascending, descending, or wave-like).

- Start with a narrow range (small intervals) and expand for climactic moments.
- Contrast sections with different contours (e.g., stepwise verses, leaping choruses).

**Example:**

- Verse: Stepwise motion (C–D–E–D).
- Chorus: Wider leaps (E–G–C).

#### **Range**: Low for introspection, high for emotional peaks.

- Ensure the range fits the vocalist’s comfort zone.

---

### **3. Rhythmic Variety**

#### **Syncopation**

- Add syncopation by placing notes off the beat for energy and interest.

**Example:**

- Straight rhythm: "Do you hear me now?" (quarter notes).
- Syncopated rhythm: "Do you HEAR me now?" (stressing offbeats).

#### **Duration and Pacing**

- Mix short, staccato notes with long, sustained notes for contrast.

**Example:**

- **Verse**: Short notes for storytelling (C–D–E–D).
- **Chorus**: Longer, held notes for impact (G–C).

---

### **4. Emotional Connection**

#### **Align Melody with Emotion**

- Sad songs: Use minor scales and descending patterns.
- Happy songs: Major scales with upward motion.
- Tension: Chromaticism (half-step motion) or unresolved leaps.

**Example:**

- Happy: Ascend in C major (C–E–G).
- Sad: Descend in A minor (A–G–F–E).

#### **Dynamic Expression**

- Crescendo into emotional moments (e.g., higher pitch, louder volume).
- Contrast soft verses with powerful choruses.

---

### **5. Use Repetition and Variation**

- Repetition makes a melody memorable.
- Add subtle variations (e.g., change rhythm, pitch, or end note).

**Example:**

- Original: "Let me go, let me go."
- Variation: "Let me stay, let me go."

---

### **6. Contrast with Harmony**

- Contrast the melody with the harmony for tension and release.
- Try counter-melodies or inversions to add depth.

**Example:**

- Guitar plays C chord → Melody focuses on E (third).
- Tension: Add D (suspension).
- Resolve: Return to C.

---

### **7. Improvisation**

- Hum, whistle, or play freely over a progression.
- Record improvisations to capture natural ideas.

---

### **8. Word-Melody Matching**

- **Syllable Matching**: Ensure the melody accommodates the syllable count of the lyrics.
- **Stress Emphasis**: Align strong beats with important words.

**Example:**

- Lyrics: "We are stronger than before."
- Stress: "WE are STRONG-er THAN be-FORE."

---

### **9. Borrow Techniques**

#### **Call and Response**

- Use one phrase as a "call" and follow it with a contrasting "response."

**Example:**

- Call: "I can't forget you" (C–D–E).
- Response: "You're still in my mind" (E–D–C).

#### **Motifs**

- Create a short, recurring melodic phrase that acts as a signature.

**Example:**

- Motif: G–A–B (intro).
- Repeat in verse or chorus with variation.

---

### **10. Explore Modes and Scales**

- Step outside major/minor scales for unique melodies.
- **Dorian Mode**: Adds a jazzy or dreamy feel.
- **Pentatonic Scale**: Simple, universally appealing melodies.
- **Chromatic Runs**: Tension-building sequences.

---

### **11. Analyze Other Songs**

- Deconstruct melodies you admire.
- Ask:
    - What makes it catchy?
    - How does it interact with the harmony?
    - Is it rhythmically interesting?

---

### **12. Test on an Instrument**

- Play the melody on a keyboard or guitar.
- Use instruments to expand ideas (e.g., transpose a vocal idea to a different key).

---

### **13. Write for the Voice**

- Ensure the melody is singable:
    - Avoid awkward leaps or sustained notes that strain the voice.
    - Test the melody with different phrasing.

---

### **14. Software and Tools**

- **DAW (Logic, Ableton):** Use MIDI to visualize melody shape.
- [**Hookpad:**]() Generate or analyze melodies.
- **Scaler 2:** Suggests scales and melodic patterns.

---

### **Practical Exercise**

1. Pick a chord progression: C–G–Am–F.
2. Improvise or hum over the chords.
3. Capture your ideas with a simple recording.
4. Refine the melody by adding variations and rhythm.
5. Test with lyrics, focusing on emotional resonance.
