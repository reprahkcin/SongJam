### **Strategies for Writing Pre-Choruses and Choruses**

The **pre-chorus** and **chorus** are critical components of a song’s structure. The pre-chorus builds tension and transitions smoothly from the verse, while the chorus serves as the emotional and melodic high point. Both sections should amplify the song’s central theme and provide contrast with the verse.

### **Pre-Chorus**

#### **Purpose**:

- Build momentum and anticipation leading into the chorus.
- Provide contrast with the verse (melodically, harmonically, or rhythmically).

#### **Techniques for Writing Pre-Choruses**:

1. **Melodic Shift**:
    
    - Use a rising melodic pattern to create a sense of build-up.
    - Example: If the verse melody stays low, increase pitch or intensity in the pre-chorus.
2. **Rhythmic Variation**:
    
    - Increase rhythmic density or syncopation.
    - Example: Move from a slower verse rhythm to faster, driving phrasing.
3. **Harmonic Progression**:
    
    - Use transitional chords to create tension.
    - Example Progressions:
        - **ii - V - I**: Classic resolution leading into the tonic.
        - **IV - V - vi - IV**: Maintains movement while delaying resolution.
    - Consider a modulation or borrowed chord (e.g., a bVII in a major key).
4. **Lyrics**:
    
    - Raise stakes or set up the chorus lyrically.
    - Example:
        - Verse: _“I’ve been wandering through the night.”_
        - Pre-Chorus: _“But I know the dawn will break so bright.”_
5. **Dynamic Range**:
    
    - Build intensity through instrumentation:
        - Add drums or bass.
        - Introduce vocal harmonies or subtle backing vocals.

### **Chorus**

#### **Purpose**:

- The emotional and thematic centerpiece of the song.
- Memorable and impactful, often containing the “hook.”

#### **Techniques for Writing Choruses**:

1. **Melodic Hooks**:
    
    - Write a melody that contrasts with the verse and is easy to sing or hum.
    - Use repetition and simplicity to make it catchy.
        - Example: Use small intervals and rhythmic repetition for accessibility.
2. **Harmonic Anchoring**:
    
    - Often, the chorus resolves to the tonic chord (I) for a satisfying conclusion.
    - Example Progressions:
        - **I - V - vi - IV**: Universally uplifting (used in countless pop songs).
        - **vi - IV - I - V**: Reflective but climactic.
3. **Lyrical Impact**:
    
    - Summarize the song’s emotional or thematic core in a few lines.
    - Repetition helps reinforce the hook.
        - Example: _“We will rise, we will rise, higher than the stars tonight.”_
4. **Dynamic Contrast**:
    
    - Make the chorus louder, fuller, and more energetic than the verse.
    - Techniques:
        - Add more instruments or vocal layers.
        - Use “call-and-response” backing vocals for texture.
5. **Instrumentation**:
    
    - Use broader textures compared to the verse.
    - Examples:
        - In a rock song, the verse might be guitar and vocals, while the chorus adds drums and bass.
        - In pop, use bright synths and vocal doubling to emphasize the chorus.

### **Building from the Verse**

#### **Melodic Evolution**:

- Contrast:
    - If the verse is stepwise (moving in small intervals), use leaps or wider intervals in the pre-chorus and chorus.
    - Example:
        - Verse: _“Walking through the rain, step by step.”_
        - Chorus: _“I’m soaring, I’m flying, I’m free.”_

#### **Harmonic Contrast**:

- Change the harmonic rhythm (the speed of chord changes).
    - Example:
        - Verse: One chord every two measures.
        - Chorus: A new chord every measure.

#### **Dynamic Build**:

- Gradually increase energy across the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.
    - Example:
        - Verse: Acoustic guitar and vocals.
        - Pre-Chorus: Add percussion or a bass line.
        - Chorus: Full band with layered instrumentation.

### **Key Considerations**

#### **Contrast is Key**:

- The pre-chorus and chorus should both provide a sense of arrival while offering contrast with each other and the verse.
    - Example:
        - Verse: Minor key, sparse texture.
        - Pre-Chorus: Rising melody, building tension.
        - Chorus: Major key, broad instrumentation.

#### **Repetition vs. Variation**:

- The pre-chorus can be slightly varied across repetitions to reflect emotional growth.
- The chorus should remain consistent, reinforcing the hook.

#### **Transition Techniques**:

- Use leading tones or cadences to smoothly bridge sections.
- Instrumental fills (e.g., drum rolls, guitar licks) can mark transitions effectively.
