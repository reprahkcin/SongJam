### **Texture and Layering**

#### **Purpose**: Control density and complexity across sections.

**Techniques**:

1. **Layer Gradually**:
    
    - Add layers to create energy and remove them for intimacy.
    - Example:
        - Verse 1: Single vocal with piano.
        - Pre-Chorus: Add bass.
        - Chorus: Add full drum kit, synths, and harmonies.
2. **Vary Textures Between Sections**:
    
    - Use contrasting textures to differentiate sections.
    - Example:
        - Pre-Chorus: Thin texture (e.g., guitar and bass only).
        - Chorus: Full texture (e.g., drums, synths, vocals, harmonies).
3. **Incorporate Drops or Breakdowns**:
    
    - Strip down to minimal elements for dramatic contrast.
    - Example: After a big chorus, drop to just vocals and a pad in the bridge.
