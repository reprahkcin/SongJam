### **1. Pre-Mastering Setup**

#### **Purpose**: Prepare the mix for final mastering adjustments.

**Steps**:

1. **Ensure a Clean Mix**:
    
    - Remove unused tracks, noise, or excessive reverb that could clutter the master.
    - Bounce your mix to a single stereo track (at 24-bit, 44.1 kHz or higher).
2. **Check Headroom**:
    
    - Ensure the mix peaks around **-6 dB** to leave room for mastering effects.
    - Avoid clipping the mix bus.
3. **Reference Tracks**:
    
    - Load 1–2 professionally mastered tracks in a similar style for comparison.
    - Use a level-matched playback plugin like **Metric AB** for reference listening.

### **2. Mastering Chain Workflow**

#### **Purpose**: Apply essential processing in a systematic order.

**Steps**:

1. **EQ for Balance**:
    
    - Subtractive EQ: Address any problem frequencies.
        - Example:
            - Cut 200–500 Hz to reduce muddiness.
            - Cut 2–3 kHz if harshness is present.
    - Additive EQ: Add subtle enhancements.
        - Example:
            - Boost 60–80 Hz for bass warmth.
            - Boost 10–15 kHz for "air" or brightness.
2. **Compression for Glue**:
    
    - Apply light compression to unify elements without squashing dynamics.
    - Settings:
        - Ratio: 1.5:1 to 2:1.
        - Attack: Slow (30–50 ms) to preserve transients.
        - Release: Medium (100–200 ms).
        - Gain Reduction: Aim for 1–3 dB.
3. **Saturation for Warmth**:
    
    - Use tape or tube saturation plugins to add harmonic richness.
    - Example:
        - Softube Tape or Waves J37 for subtle analog warmth.
4. **Stereo Imaging**:
    
    - Widen the stereo field for depth and presence.
    - **Tips**:
        - Focus widening on mid-high frequencies (2–8 kHz).
        - Keep bass frequencies mono to avoid phase issues.
        - Use plugins like iZotope Ozone’s Imager for precision.
5. **Limiter for Loudness**:
    
    - Apply a brick-wall limiter to achieve competitive loudness without distortion.
    - Settings:
        - Output Ceiling: **-1 dB** (to avoid clipping on streaming platforms).
        - Threshold: Adjust until you hit your loudness target.
    - Targets:
        - Streaming: **-14 LUFS** (Spotify, Apple Music).
        - Competitive: **-9 to -12 LUFS** (for more "radio-ready" tracks).

### **3. Optional Steps for Extra Time**

#### **Purpose**: Refine the master further if additional time is available.

1. **Dynamic EQ**:
    
    - Address specific frequency imbalances dynamically (only when needed).
    - Example: Reduce harshness in vocals at 3 kHz during loud sections.
2. **Multi-Band Compression**:
    
    - Apply compression to specific frequency bands for detailed control.
    - Example:
        - Tighten bass: Compress 20–120 Hz.
        - Smooth mids: Compress 500 Hz–2 kHz.
3. **Transient Shaping**:
    
    - Enhance or control transients for punch and clarity.
    - Example: Boost transients in drums and reduce them in vocals for balance.
4. **Fine-Tune Stereo Imaging**:
    
    - Add automation to widen the stereo field in choruses or narrow it in verses.

### **4. Scaling the Workflow**

#### **3-Minute Pass**:

- **EQ**: Quick balance adjustments to eliminate muddiness and add clarity.
- **Compression**: Light compression to glue the mix.
- **Limiter**: Push for loudness while preserving dynamics.

#### **5–10 Minute Pass**:

- Follow the 3-minute process, then:
    - Add saturation and stereo imaging for depth.
    - Use a dynamic EQ to address problem areas.

#### **15–20 Minute Pass**:

- Follow the 5–10 minute process, then:
    - Refine loudness balance for different platforms (e.g., streaming vs. radio).
    - Automate stereo width and transient shaping for added polish.

### **5. Quick Mastering Workflow Example**

1. **Step 1: EQ**:
    
    - Cut 250 Hz to reduce mud.
    - Boost 12 kHz for air.
2. **Step 2: Compression**:
    
    - Apply 2:1 ratio, 30 ms attack, 150 ms release.
3. **Step 3: Saturation**:
    
    - Add subtle tape saturation.
4. **Step 4: Stereo Imaging**:
    
    - Widen 2–8 kHz by 10%.
5. **Step 5: Limiter**:
    
    - Set ceiling at -1 dB.
    - Adjust threshold for -12 LUFS.

### **7. Troubleshooting and Final Checks**

- **Harsh Highs**:
    - Use a dynamic EQ to reduce excessive brightness.
- **Overwhelming Bass**:
    - Use a high-pass filter or tighten the bass with compression.
- **Lack of Loudness**:
    - Increase limiter threshold cautiously or use saturation to add perceived loudness.
