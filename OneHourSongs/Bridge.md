### **Writing the Bridge**

#### **Purpose**: The bridge offers contrast—lyrically and musically. It provides a twist or new perspective.

**Best Practices**:

- **Contrast Emotion**:
    - Shift the tone of the song (e.g., from despair to hope).
    - Example: _"And now I see the sun, breaking through the clouds."_
- **Use Shorter Phrases**:
    - The bridge can break rhythmic patterns for impact.
    - Example: _"I thought I’d fall forever. But now I’m learning to fly."_

#### Techniques:

- **Perspective Shift**:
    - Rewrite a line from another character’s point of view.
    - Example: Chorus: _"I’m moving on."_ Bridge: _"You’re watching me leave."_
- **Time Change**:
    - Use the bridge to jump into the future or reflect on the past.
