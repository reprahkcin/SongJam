### **Instrumentation**

#### **Purpose**: Define the primary and supporting instruments in each section.

**Best Practices**:

1. **Start Simple**:
    
    - Use fewer instruments in verses and build complexity in the chorus.
    - Example:
        - Verse: Acoustic guitar and vocals.
        - Chorus: Add bass, drums, and backing vocals.
2. **Leverage Instrument Roles**:
    
    - **Melodic Instruments**: Lead (vocals, guitar solos).
    - **Harmonic Instruments**: Chords (piano, rhythm guitar).
    - **Rhythmic Instruments**: Percussion, drums.
    - **Texture/Atmosphere**: Pads, strings, or effects.
