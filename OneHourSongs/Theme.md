#### **Purpose**: Establish what the song is about—emotion, story, or message.

**Best Practices**:

- **Prompts for Fast Ideas**:
    - Use a **random prompt generator** (e.g., "Write about longing through the metaphor of seasons").
    - Browse a collection of curated [[Prompts]]
- **Batch Processing**:
    - Pre-generate themes for multiple songs at once and keep a list on hand.
    - Example: Write 20 themes in one sitting, pull from the list as needed.
