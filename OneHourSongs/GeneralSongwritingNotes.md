- Remember, a good prechorus never hurt anybody.
- Instrumental sections are nice, too.
- Refrains instead of choruses
- Chorus melody advice
	- First or most important note should be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th of the major scale
	- You can start your melody before, on, or after the first beat
	- create small motifs and repeat and move them around.
