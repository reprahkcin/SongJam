### **1. Setting Up Your Workflow**

#### **Purpose**: Optimize your DAW and tools for MIDI programming.

**Steps**:

1. **DAW Template**:
    
    - Pre-create tracks for common MIDI instruments (e.g., piano, bass, pads, drums).
    - Route tracks to buses (e.g., a Synth Bus, Percussion Bus).
2. **Load Plugins**:
    
    - **Scaler**: Assign Scaler to your chord-generation track.
    - **Hookpad**: Use the web app or export MIDI files into your DAW.
    - Additional MIDI Tools: Load arpeggiators, sequencers, or chord plugins as needed.
3. **Set Key and Tempo**:
    
    - Decide on the key and tempo of your project before programming.
    - Example:
        - Key: C Major.
        - Tempo: 120 BPM.

### **2. Programming Chord Progressions**

#### **Purpose**: Generate and program harmonic foundations.

**Using Scaler**:

1. **Select Key and Scale**:
    
    - Open Scaler and choose a key and scale that fits your song’s mood.
    - Example: A Minor for melancholic vibes, C Major for uplifting themes.
2. **Generate Progressions**:
    
    - Use Scaler’s built-in chord sets (e.g., Pop, Cinematic) or create your own.
    - Example:
        - Verse: Am - F - C - G (vi-IV-I-V).
        - Chorus: C - G - Am - F (I-V-vi-IV).
3. **Drag and Drop**:
    
    - Drag the generated MIDI chords directly into your DAW’s timeline.
    - Assign these chords to your harmonic instrument track (e.g., piano, pad).

**Using Hookpad**:

1. **Build Progressions**:
    
    - Use Hookpad’s visual interface to construct chord progressions.
    - Experiment with borrowed chords or modulations.
    - Example: Add a bVII chord for tension (C - G - Bb - F).
2. **Export MIDI**:
    
    - Export the chord progression MIDI file and import it into your DAW.

**Enhancements**:

- Adjust velocity for dynamic variation.
- Apply inversions or voicing changes directly in the DAW piano roll.

### **3. Adding Basslines**

#### **Purpose**: Create a rhythmic and harmonic foundation.

**Steps**:

1. **Sync with Chords**:
    
    - Use Scaler or Hookpad to generate basslines that follow chord root notes.
    - Example:
        - Chord: Am (A-C-E).
        - Bassline: A → E → A (simple root and fifth).
2. **Add Rhythmic Variation**:
    
    - Use shorter notes to match drum patterns.
    - Example:
        - Chord lasts 4 beats: Program the bassline as A (1st beat), E (3rd beat), A (4th beat).
3. **Arpeggiate for Interest**:
    
    - Use MIDI arpeggiators to create ascending or descending bass patterns.
    - Example:
        - Am chord: A → C → E → A (octave higher).

### **4. Programming Melodies**

#### **Purpose**: Generate lead lines or vocal-like melodies.

**Using Scaler**:

1. **Melody Generator**:
    - Use Scaler’s "Melody" feature to generate melodic patterns based on your scale.
2. **Manual Input**:
    - Play melodies on a MIDI controller, quantizing them for tight timing.

**Using Hookpad**:

1. **Add Melody Notes**:
    - Drag melody notes above your chord progression.
    - Use passing tones and rhythmic variety for interest.

**Refinements**:

- Add velocity variation for expressiveness.
- Use legato or staccato articulations based on the instrument.

### **5. Adding Drums**

#### **Purpose**: Establish rhythm and energy.

**Steps**:

1. **Use MIDI Grooves**:
    
    - Drag pre-made drum grooves from a MIDI library or plugin (e.g., Superior Drummer, Logic’s Drummer).
    - Example:
        - Verse: Sparse kick-snare pattern.
        - Chorus: Full drum kit with hi-hats and crashes.
2. **Layer Percussion**:
    
    - Add MIDI tracks for auxiliary percussion (e.g., tambourine, shakers).
3. **Adjust for Dynamics**:
    
    - Use velocity layers to simulate realistic drum hits.
    - Example:
        - Verse: Lower velocity for a softer sound.
        - Chorus: Higher velocity for intensity.

### **6. Layering Pads and Atmosphere**

#### **Purpose**: Add texture and depth.

**Steps**:

1. **Choose a Warm Pad**:
    
    - Use presets in synths like Serum, Omnisphere, or Massive.
2. **Match Chords**:
    
    - Duplicate the chord MIDI track to the pad instrument track.
    - Add movement with automation (e.g., filter sweeps, volume swells).
3. **Add Atmospherics**:
    
    - Use MIDI tracks for evolving soundscapes.
    - Example:
        - Reverse MIDI notes for a swelling effect.

### **7. Fine-Tuning with MIDI Editing**

#### **Purpose**: Refine performance for realism and flow.

**Techniques**:

1. **Humanize Timing**:
    
    - Slightly offset MIDI notes to simulate human timing imperfections.
    - Example:
        - Quantize to 90% for a less robotic feel.
2. **Velocity Layers**:
    
    - Vary note velocities for dynamics.
    - Example:
        - Bass notes: Lower velocity for softer sections.
        - Lead notes: Increase velocity for accents.
3. **Legato and Articulation**:
    
    - Use legato for smooth transitions or staccato for punchy attacks.
    - Example:
        - Strings: Legato in verses, pizzicato in choruses.

### **8. Exporting and Preparing for Mixing**

#### **Purpose**: Prepare MIDI tracks for easy manipulation during mixing.

**Steps**:

1. **Bounce to Audio**:
    
    - Export MIDI tracks as audio to reduce CPU usage.
    - Keep original MIDI tracks for edits if needed.
2. **Organize Tracks**:
    
    - Group MIDI instruments by type (e.g., keys, pads, leads).
    - Label tracks clearly for mixing.

---

### **9. Workflow Example**

1. **Step 1**: Use Scaler to program chord progressions and import into the DAW.
2. **Step 2**: Create a bassline using Scaler’s "Performance" mode.
3. **Step 3**: Add a lead melody with Hookpad’s MIDI export.
4. **Step 4**: Layer atmospheric pads and arpeggiated patterns.
5. **Step 5**: Program drums using MIDI grooves and adjust velocity layers.
6. **Step 6**: Fine-tune timing and dynamics for natural playback.
