### **Harmonic Melodies**

## See also [Harmony](Harmony.md)

#### **Purpose**: Use supporting melodies to add depth and richness to the vocal melody.

**Best Practices**:

- **Counter-Melodies**:
    
    - Write melodies that contrast with the main melody rhythmically or tonally.
    - Example:
        - Vocal melody: _"Hold me close."_
        - Harmonic melody: Arpeggiated chords (e.g., C-E-G).
- **Parallel Harmony**:
    
    - Double the vocal melody in thirds or sixths.
    - Example:
        - Melody: _"You are the light."_
        - Harmony: Add a third above (_"G-B-D"_ under "C-E-G").
- **Chord-Tone Emphasis**:
    
    - Build harmonic melodies around the notes of the underlying chord.
    - Example:
        - Chord: Am (A-C-E).
        - Melody: Create a pattern using A-C-E.

### **Integration Techniques**

#### **Purpose**: Ensure the melody, harmony, and chords work seamlessly together.

**Techniques**:

- **Lyric-to-Melody Fit**:
    
    - Align syllables with melodic stress points.
    - Example:
        - Word emphasis: _“I will rise”_ → Strongest note on “rise.”
- **Dynamic Layering**:
    
    - Start with simple instrumentation in verses and build up harmonic layers in the chorus.
- **Melody-Led Harmony**:
    
    - Write the melody first and derive chords to fit.
    - Example:
        - Melody: C-D-E → Chords: C Major, Dm, Em.

### **Techniques for Writing Vocal Harmonies**

Vocal harmonies enrich a song’s texture, reinforce melodies, and enhance its emotional impact. They can be subtle or dramatic, simple or complex, depending on the style and mood of the song.

---

### **1. Types of Harmonies**

Understanding different harmony styles will help you choose the right fit for your song.

|**Harmony Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Parallel Harmony**|Follows the melody at a fixed interval (e.g., thirds or sixths).|Common in pop and folk.|
|**Counterpoint Harmony**|A second melody that is rhythmically or melodically independent but complements the main melody.|Classical or sophisticated pop.|
|**Octave Doubling**|The same melody sung an octave higher or lower.|Common in choruses for emphasis.|
|**Cluster Harmony**|Close, dissonant intervals (e.g., seconds) for tension or ethereal quality.|Ambient or experimental music.|

---

### **2. Interval Selection**

The intervals you use determine the harmonic feel of the song.

#### **Common Intervals in Harmonies**

1. **Thirds**:
    
    - Most common and pleasing.
    - Example:
        - Melody: C → D → E.
        - Harmony: E → F → G (a third above).
2. **Sixths**:
    
    - Softer, warmer sound than thirds.
    - Example:
        - Melody: C → D → E.
        - Harmony: A → B → C (a sixth below).
3. **Fifths and Octaves**:
    
    - Simple and strong but less colorful.
    - Example:
        - Melody: C → D → E.
        - Harmony: G → A → B (a fifth below or above).
4. **Seconds/Clusters**:
    
    - Create tension or a dreamy effect.
    - Example:
        - Melody: C → D → E.
        - Harmony: D → E → F.

### **3. Building Harmonies Around Chords**

Harmonies often emphasize chord tones or passing notes from the scale.

1. **Chord-Tone Harmony**:
    
    - Use notes from the underlying chord.
    - Example:
        - Chord: G Major (G-B-D).
        - Melody: B.
        - Harmony: D (fifth above), G (third below).
2. **Scale-Tone Harmony**:
    
    - Use notes from the scale rather than strictly the chord.
    - Example:
        - Melody: E (in C Major).
        - Harmony: G (a third above), D (a sixth below).
3. **Arpeggiated Harmony**:
    
    - Harmonize by arpeggiating the chord.
    - Example:
        - Melody: G.
        - Harmony: B → D (ascending arpeggio in G Major).

### **4. Placement of Harmonies**

The placement of harmonies can drastically affect the mood and energy.

1. **Full Chorus Harmonies**:
    
    - Harmonize every line in the chorus to add grandeur.
    - Works well in anthemic or uplifting songs.
2. **Selective Harmonies**:
    
    - Add harmonies only to key phrases or words for emphasis.
    - Example: Harmonize just the word “rise” in _"I will rise."_
3. **Layering Techniques**:
    
    - Start with a solo melody in the verse and add harmonies progressively.
    - Example: Verse → single voice; Pre-Chorus → one harmony; Chorus → full harmony stack.

---

### **5. Dynamic Techniques**

Use dynamics to shape how harmonies interact with the main vocal.

- **Blend and Subtlety**:
    
    - Keep harmonies slightly quieter than the melody for support.
    - Example: Backing harmonies in Adele’s _"Someone Like You."_
- **Call and Response**:
    
    - Use harmonies as a response to the main vocal.
    - Example:
        - Lead: _"I’m free."_
        - Harmony: _"Soaring high."_
- **Panning for Space**:
    
    - Pan harmonies left and right for stereo width, leaving the lead vocal in the center.

---

### **6. Stylistic Applications**

Different genres favor specific harmony approaches.

|**Genre**|**Harmony Style**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Pop**|Parallel thirds or sixths, selective doubling.|_"Shallow"_ by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.|
|**Folk**|Close harmonies, often parallel thirds.|Simon & Garfunkel.|
|**Rock**|Power intervals (octaves, fifths).|Queen’s multi-layered harmonies.|
|**Gospel**|Complex, stacked harmonies with wide intervals.|Any gospel choir arrangement.|
|**Indie**|Sparse, ethereal harmonies for mood.|Bon Iver’s vocoder-layered harmonies.|

---

### **7. Experimentation**

Use tools and techniques to explore creative harmony ideas.

1. **Reverse Harmonies**:
    
    - Record a harmony line and reverse it for an eerie, unique effect.
2. **Improvise With MIDI**:
    
    - Play the melody on a MIDI keyboard and experiment with harmonies by ear.
3. **Layered Harmonizers**:
    
    - Use plugins like **Antares Harmony Engine** or **Melodyne** to generate harmonies automatically.

### **8. Tools for Writing Harmonies**

- **DAW Automation**:
    - Duplicate the melody track and pitch-shift it to create harmonies.
- **Harmony Assistant**:
    - Tools like **iZotope Nectar** or **Antares Auto-Tune** for creating and refining harmonies.
