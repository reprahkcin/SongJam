### **Narrative Outline**

#### **Purpose**: Define what happens emotionally or narratively in each section.

|Section|Role in Narrative|Example Emotional Shift|
|---|---|---|
|**Intro**|Sets tone or mood.|Calm to energetic.|
|**Verse 1**|Introduces context or story.|Reflection or discovery.|
|**Chorus**|Emotional core or theme of the song.|Uplifting, powerful, or heartbreaking.|
|**Verse 2**|Adds depth or conflict.|Hope fades, tension rises.|
|**Bridge**|Contrasts or provides resolution.|Epiphany, unexpected twist.|
|**Outro**|Brings closure or leaves ambiguity.|Fade-out, big ending, or unresolved.|

**Best Practices**:

- **Rapid Questions**:
    - What’s the emotion here?
    - How does it evolve from the last section?
    - What’s the listener meant to feel?

#### Quick Example:

- Intro: **Acoustic guitar riff**, sets a calm mood.
- Verse 1: **Story of heartbreak**, soft vocals.
- Chorus: **Empowerment**, soaring melody.
- Bridge: **Resolution**, instrumentation drop-off, reflective tone.
