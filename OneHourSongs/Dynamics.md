### **Dynamics**

#### **Purpose**: Create emotional impact by varying intensity throughout the song.

**Best Practices**:

1. **Build Intensity**:
    
    - Gradually increase volume, energy, and instrumentation.
    - Example:
        - Verse 1: Soft piano and vocal.
        - Pre-Chorus: Add drums and bass.
        - Chorus: Full instrumentation at a higher dynamic.
2. **Use Silence and Restraint**:
    
    - Pauses or quiet moments can add dramatic tension.
    - Example: Stop all instruments for one beat before the chorus drops.
3. **Crescendos and Swells**:
    
    - Use rising dynamics in strings, synth pads, or drums to build energy.
