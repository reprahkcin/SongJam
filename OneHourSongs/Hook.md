### **Writing the Hook**

#### **Purpose**: The hook is the focal point of your song, often in the chorus, and should be catchy, memorable, and emotionally resonant.

**Best Practices**:

- **Keep It Simple**:
    - Limit to 1-2 lines.
    - Example: _"I’m falling like the leaves, carried by the breeze."_
- **Use Repetition**:
    - Repeating key phrases enhances memorability.
    - Example: _"We’re lost, but we’re alive. We’re lost, but we’re alive."_

**Techniques for Generating Hooks**:

- **Emotion First**:
    - Start by identifying the core emotion (e.g., longing, joy, defiance).
    - Example: For defiance: _"You can’t dim my light."_
- **Metaphor Generator**:
    - Think of a visual or physical representation of the emotion.
    - Example: Instead of saying “I’m lonely,” write: _"An empty chair at a crowded table."_
- **Rhyme Pairing**:
    - Brainstorm rhyming word pairs related to your theme.
    - Example: Light/Fight, Rain/Pain, Home/Roam.
