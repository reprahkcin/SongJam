### **1. Understand the Basics of Harmony**

#### **What is Harmony?**

- Harmony occurs when two or more notes are sung simultaneously to create a pleasing sound.
- Harmonies typically move in intervals (e.g., thirds, sixths) relative to the melody.

#### **Chord Tones vs. Non-Chord Tones**

- **Chord Tones:** Notes within the current chord (e.g., root, third, fifth). These are the most stable and consonant harmonies.
- **Non-Chord Tones:** Notes outside the chord. These can add tension or color but need careful resolution.

---

### **2. Build Harmony in Intervals**

#### **Thirds (Most Common)**

- Harmony follows the melody by singing a note a third above or below.
- **Example (C Major Chord):**
    - Melody: C → E → G.
    - Harmony (3rd above): E → G → B.

#### **Sixths (Rich and Smooth)**

- Harmonize a sixth above or below the melody.
- **Example (C Major Chord):**
    - Melody: C → E → G.
    - Harmony (6th below): A → C → E.

#### **Octaves (Simple and Effective)**

- Sing the same melody an octave higher or lower for reinforcement.

---

### **3. Match the Chord Progression**

- Harmonies should align with the chords:
    - If the melody note is **C** over an F chord, the harmony could be A (third above) or F (root).

---

### **4. Use Parallel or Contrary Motion**

#### **Parallel Motion**

- Harmony moves in the same direction as the melody, maintaining consistent intervals.
- **Example:**
    - Melody: C → D → E.
    - Harmony: E → F → G.

#### **Contrary Motion**

- Harmony moves in the opposite direction to the melody, creating contrast.
- **Example:**
    - Melody: C → D → E.
    - Harmony: G → F → E.

---

### **5. Add Layers for Depth**

#### **Double Tracking**

- Sing the same melody or harmony line multiple times to create a fuller sound.

#### **Stacking Harmonies**

- Add multiple harmonies above and below the melody for a choir effect.
- **Example:**
    - Melody: G.
    - Harmony 1 (3rd above): B.
    - Harmony 2 (6th below): E.

---

### **6. Create Dynamic Movement**

- Harmonies don’t need to follow the melody at all times.
    - Use harmonies selectively (e.g., in the chorus or key emotional moments).
    - Drop in and out for variety.

---

### **7. Experiment with Dissonance**

- Add tension by using dissonant intervals (e.g., seconds or sevenths) that resolve to consonance.
- **Example:**
    - Melody: G → A → G.
    - Harmony: F → G → E (creates tension on the F-A interval, resolves with G-E).

---

### **8. Use Call and Response**

- Harmonies can act as "responses" to the melody.
- **Example:**
    - Melody: “I feel alive...” (Lead vocal).
    - Harmony: “Feel alive...” (Backing harmony).

---

### **9. Leverage Modes and Scales**

- Try harmonies in:
    - **Major Scale:** Happy and uplifting.
    - **Minor Scale:** Melancholic and emotional.
    - **Modal Harmony:** Experiment with Dorian, Mixolydian, or Lydian for unique flavors.

---

### **10. Test with Lyrics**

- Ensure the harmonies fit the syllables and rhythm of the melody.
- Avoid overloading complex harmonies during fast lyrical passages.

---

### **11. Use Tools to Experiment**

#### **DAW and Plugins**

- **Logic Pro X:** Use the pitch-shifting feature to create harmonies.
- **Melodyne:** Analyze the melody and generate harmonies by shifting notes.
- **Antares Harmony Engine:** Automatically creates harmonies in real time.

#### **Keyboard or Guitar**

- Play chord tones to test harmonies against the melody.
- **Example:**
    - Sing the melody while playing harmonizing notes on a keyboard.

---

### **12. Reference Songs with Great Harmonies**

- Study songs with strong harmonies:
    - **The Beatles:** "Because" (layered 3-part harmonies).
    - **Fleetwood Mac:** "Dreams" (smooth backing harmonies).
    - **Queen:** "Bohemian Rhapsody" (stacked operatic harmonies).

---

### **13. Practice and Record**

- Improvise harmonies while listening to the melody.
- Record multiple takes and experiment with panning harmonies left and right for stereo width.

---

### **14. Example in Practice**

#### Chord Progression: G–C–D

- **Melody:** B → D → G.
- **Harmony (3rd above):** D → F → B.
- **Harmony (6th below):** G → A → E.
