### **1. General DAW Setup**

#### **Purpose**: Create a template that minimizes repetitive tasks and improves efficiency.

**Steps**:

1. **Create a DAW Template**:
    
    - Include tracks, routing, plugins, and markers for standard song sections.
    - Save it as a project template for reuse.
2. **Label and Organize Tracks**:
    
    - Pre-name tracks (e.g., Rhythm Guitar, Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums, Vocals).
    - Use consistent naming conventions for easy navigation.
3. **Color-Coding**:
    
    - Assign colors to track groups for visual clarity.
    - Example:
        - Vocals: Blue.
        - Guitars: Green.
        - Drums: Red.
        - FX: Purple.
4. **Set Markers for Song Sections**:
    
    - Add markers (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.) to structure your session.
    - Example: Set markers for 4-bar increments to keep tracking organized.

### **2. Configuring for Live Tracking**

#### **Purpose**: Ensure smooth and latency-free recording.

**Steps**:

1. **Optimize Buffer Size**:
    
    - Use a low buffer size (64 or 128 samples) to reduce latency during recording.
    - Increase the buffer size (512 or higher) during mixing to handle more plugins.
2. **Set Up Input Channels**:
    
    - Route inputs from your audio interface to corresponding DAW tracks.
    - Assign mono or stereo inputs based on the instrument:
        - Mono: Vocals, guitars, bass.
        - Stereo: Keyboards, synths, or drum overheads.
3. **Enable Monitoring**:
    
    - Turn on direct monitoring via your audio interface for zero-latency playback.
    - If monitoring through your DAW:
        - Use plugins sparingly to minimize latency.
4. **Pre-Load Amp Sims and Effects**:
    
    - Add amp simulators (e.g., Neural DSP, Amplitube) to guitar and bass tracks.
    - Use light reverb or compression for inspiration but bypass these during final mixing.
5. **Click Track Setup**:
    
    - Program a click track to align with the song’s tempo.
    - Adjust volume to ensure it’s audible but not distracting.

### **3. Track Layout and Routing**

#### **Purpose**: Organize tracks to simplify editing, mixing, and mastering.

**Steps**:

1. **Group Tracks**:
    
    - Use buses or folders to group similar tracks.
    - Example:
        - All drum mics → Drum Bus.
        - Rhythm guitars → Guitar Bus.
2. **Submix Routing**:
    
    - Route grouped tracks to specific buses for better control.
    - Example:
        - Vocals → Vocal Bus → Master.
        - Instruments → Instrument Bus → Master.
3. **Auxiliary Channels for Effects**:
    
    - Set up reverb, delay, and parallel compression on aux tracks.
    - Send individual tracks to these channels as needed.

**Routing Diagram**:

[Individual Tracks] → [Group Buses] → [Master Bus] 

Example:  Vocals → Vocal Bus → Master Guitars → Guitar Bus → Master Drums → Drum Bus → Master

### **4. Plugin Chain Setup**

#### **Purpose**: Pre-load essential plugins for tracking and mixing.

**Plugin Chains for Live Tracking**:

1. **Vocals**:
    
    - Light EQ: Roll off low frequencies (<100 Hz).
    - Compression: Moderate compression (3:1 ratio).
    - Reverb: Short plate for inspiration (bypass during mixing).
2. **Guitars**:
    
    - Amp Simulator: Choose clean or distorted presets.
    - EQ: Roll off low frequencies (<80 Hz).
    - Light Reverb: Adds space while tracking.
3. **Bass**:
    
    - DI Input: Clean bass tone.
    - Compression: Slow attack, medium release to even dynamics.
    - Optional Distortion: Adds grit if needed.
4. **Drums**:
    
    - Overhead Mics: High-pass filter at 150 Hz.
    - Kick: Add a touch of sub-bass or EQ for clarity.
    - Snare: Boost 200 Hz for body and 5 kHz for snap.

### **5. Automating Workflow with Macros and Shortcuts**

#### **Purpose**: Speed up repetitive tasks with hotkeys and macros.

**Examples**:

- **Record Multiple Takes**:
    - Use a hotkey to toggle loop recording.
- **Track Comping**:
    - Assign a shortcut for splitting and comping takes.
- **Instant Save**:
    - Set autosave intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

### **6. Preparing for Mixing and Mastering**

#### **Purpose**: Lay the groundwork for smooth transitions to mixing and mastering.

**Steps**:

1. **Gain Staging**:
    
    - Set input levels to peak around -6 dB to avoid clipping.
    - Adjust faders to keep the mix balanced without distortion.
2. **Remove Unnecessary Plugins**:
    
    - Bypass or remove tracking effects (e.g., reverb) to avoid clutter.
3. **Export Stems** (Optional):
    
    - Prepare consolidated tracks (e.g., one track per instrument group) for external mixing or mastering.

### **7. Backup and Save Protocols**

#### **Purpose**: Prevent data loss and ensure version control.

**Steps**:

1. **File Management**:
    - Save the project with clear naming conventions (e.g., SongName_Tracking_v1).
2. **Backups**:
    - Save to an external drive or cloud storage after major sessions.
3. **Project Folder Structure**:
    - Organize by subfolders:
        - _Audio Files_
        - _MIDI_
        - _Bounces_
        - _Session Files_
